// The Array in JavaScript is a global object which contains a list of items. It is similar to any variable, in that you can use it to hold any type of data. However, it has one important difference: it can hold more than one item of data at a time.

// How do we create a Array?
// Create a table with a pair of square brackets [] . Everything within the brackets makes up the array 

// let movies = ["PS i Love You", "TiTanic"];

// Since an Arry contains mulitiple things, it is good to name the aarray using a plural (for example movies)

// Identity an arraay size

// the number of elements stored in a table is called its size. here how to access it.

let movies = ["PS i Love You", "TiTanic" , "Nemo"];

movies.push ("BBT");    

console.log (movies[3])

// console.log (movies [0]) ;
// console.log (movies[1]);
// console.log(movies[2]);    



// Each item in an array is identifed by a number and this is called the index. we can represt an array as a set of boxes each storing a specific value and associated with an index.


// thatsis exatly thew way you access the characterisctics in a string. the same golden rule apply :

        // the index of the first array is equal to 0 (zero);
        // the  highest index number is the arrays minus 1;
